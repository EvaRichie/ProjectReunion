# Frequently Asked Questions
**When can I start using components in Project Reunion?**

Right away. See below for more information about what's already part of the Project Reunion family.


**What is available in Project Reunion?**

These components are available for you to use now and adhere to the “Project Reunion Family Promise” 
that they have a single API for use in all kinds of applications. 

- **WinUI 3 for XAML** in your Win32 app helps you build fluent UX with the ease of XAML. 
 This component {link to repo} is part of the Project Reunion Family of functionality,
 building on the identity + packaging + deployment transparent ideas that Reunion supports
 for your app as well. 

- **C++/WinRT**, **RUST/WinRT**, and **C#/WinRT** provide language-native projections of Windows, Project Reunion,
and your own custom types defined in metadata. Consume APIs from the Windows Kit, produce them for 
use by other supported projections, create your own new language projections.  

- **MSIX** and **MSIX-Core** let you package your application for distribution to Windows Desktop 
machines via the store or your own delivery pipeline.  MSIX-Core lets you use the reuse parts of 
the MSIX packaging story on older versions of Windows.
