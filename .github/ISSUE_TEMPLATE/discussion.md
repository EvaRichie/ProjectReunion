<!-- This is a template for discussion issues.
Discussion issues can be about any topics or ideas related to Project Reunion.  
For example, you might start a Discussion issue to see if others are interested in a cool new idea
 you've been thinking about that isn't quite ready to be filed as a more formal Feature Proposal.

Discussion issues can also just be used to chat about non-feature-related topics, such as whether
Project  Reunion meets (or doesn't meet) your needs.
