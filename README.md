# Project Reunion

### What is Project Reunion?
Project Reunion is a set of libraries, frameworks, components, and tools that you can use in your apps
to access powerful Windows platform functionality from all kinds of apps on Windows 10. Project Reunion 
combines the powers of Win32 native applications alongside modern API usage techniques, so your apps 
light up everywhere your users are.

### How can I use Project Reunion?
We want to start this journey with you and your apps' needs. The best way to get started is to file 
issues for functionality and needs your app has. In the near future we'll add code, samples, and 
documentation about how you can start using and contributing to Project Reunion. 

Your app can use the parts of Project Reunion that are most interesting without having to rewrite into 
a new app model or deployment system. Project Reunion provides a single consistent API surface 
for both new and existing functionality that automatically adapts to your preferred app model and 
deployment mechanism. Project Reunion helps you move towards a modern API and app style without 
requiring you to make a hard choice to rewrite or re-implement across versions of Windows. 


###  Benefits of Project Reunion

 _Windows and Project Reunion loves all your apps_

- Your existing UWP and Win32 apps continue to work on supported versions of Windows with no changes.

- Project Reunion helps your app work across more versions of Windows by filling in support and 
letting you know when features are fully available. Project Reunion APIs are backwards-compatible 
across a range of Windows versions and provide a clear message to you that an API might not be supported.

- You can incrementally adopt Project Reunion components for your existing apps and middleware 
libraries. Your Desktop Bridge, UWP, and Win32 apps can start using powerful platform APIs through Project 
Reunion at your own pace.

- Features in Project Reunion are delivered without a Windows update so you can use them everywhere 
as soon as they're available. Project Reunion stays up to date automatically, fixing issues for you.

- Project Reunion is an inclusive set of technologies allowing developers a broad range of choice. 
We will recommend technologies that deliver the best experience on the broad set of hardware we support, 
have great fundamentals, and are optimized for the cloud.

- Project Reunion works for packaged, unpackaged, UWP, Desktop Bridge, and bring-your-own identity apps. Write your app or framework code once and run it everywhere



### Project Reunion Principles

We are building a platform that is:

**1.	Compatible**

Project Reunion works in all your apps - Win32, Packaged, and UWP - and across many versions of Windows.

**2.	Modern**

Project Reunion supports your app's use of modern software libraries for UI, AI, ML, packaging, frameworks, 
and libraries. Language projections for C++, Rust, C#, and JavaScript expand the benefits to all your 
apps.  Cloud-backed apps, streaming, and edge-compute apps are all great places to use Project Reunion's 
capabilities.

**3.	Agile**

Project Reunion ships out of band with OS releases, with regular previews. You get to incrementally 
adopt Project Reunion components for your existing apps and middleware libraries.

**4.	Open**

We're committing to engineering Project Reunion in the open on GitHub, so you have a more direct 
say in how the platform evolves and even help out.


### Version Support

Project Reunion aims to work on supported versions of Windows. We'll use techniques like '_polyfill_' 
and custom implementations to make sure your app can reach the widest possible range of users.
