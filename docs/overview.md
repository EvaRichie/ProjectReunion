# Project Reunion Overview

Over the last couple of years, we have been breaking down the barriers between Win32 and UWP. We are expanding our efforts even further and finally giving this effort a name: Project Reunion

Project Reunion is:

- **The next evolution of the journey we started with UWP**. It embraces all the goodness and investments our community has done in UWP and Win32, and builds a path forward

- **it clears up the confusion around the Windows platform**, and acknowledges that supporting all Windows versions with 1B endpoints,  not just the latest, provides meaningful TAM and lowers cost for our developer base

- **this evolution will converge our divergent paths of the past and brings our developer base forward**. It unblocks future scenarios and jumpstarts the revolution of Windows apps (e.g. Cloud streamed, Cloud-hybrid, Cloud/Edge Apps)

###  Benefits of Project Reunion
- Your existing UWP and Win32 apps still work on supported versions of Windows with **no changes**
- If you build fully against Project Reunion, **we will do the work** to make your app always work across all of Windows
- You can **incrementally adopt** Project Reunion components for your existing apps and middleware libraries
- Project Reunion will **update independent of Windows releases**, and will always have the latest and greatest support for new hardware
- Project Reunion is an inclusive set of technologies allowing developers **a broad range of choice**.  We will recommend technologies that deliver the best experience on the broad set of hardware we support, have great fundamentals, and are optimized for the cloud.

### Project Reunion Principles

- **Compatible**<br>
	Unifies Win32 and UWP. With project Reunion, you won't have to pick between UWP or Win32<br>
	It works on all supported Windows versions<br>
- **Modern**<br>
	It supports the latest libraries for e.g. UI, AI, ML<br>
	Project Reunion helps you get ready for cloud integration, app streaming, edge compute, etc<br>
- **Agile**<br>
	Project Reunion ships out of band with OS releases, with regular previews<br>
	You can incrementally adopt Project Reunion components for your existing apps and middleware libraries<br>
- **Open**<br>
	We're committing to engineering Project Reunion in the open on GitHub so you have a more direct say in how the platform evolves<br>
